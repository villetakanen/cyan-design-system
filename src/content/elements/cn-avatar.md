# Avatars

Avatars are used to represent users or entities in a visual way. They are commonly used in user interfaces to provide a visual representation of a user, and can be used in a variety of contexts.

We also have a complementary component, [`cn-avatar-button`](/elements/cn-avatar-button), which is intended to be used in conjunction with `cn-avatar` to create a clickable avatar that can be used to trigger actions, like changing the user's profile picture.

## Demo

<div class="flex flex-row">
  <cn-avatar></cn-avatar>
  <cn-avatar nick="Cn"></cn-avatar>
  <cn-avatar src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1325129?v=4"></cn-avatar>
</div>
